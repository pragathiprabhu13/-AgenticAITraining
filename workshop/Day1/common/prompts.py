"""common/prompts.py - reusable prompt templates for FinDesk.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
Prompt text is business content, not application logic. Keeping every system
prompt here means:

* the same wording is reused by D1P1 (plain LangChain), D1P2 (graph) and
  D1P3 (routing) - so answers stay consistent across sessions;
* trainers can edit wording without touching workflow code;
* Session 3 can pick a different system prompt per query category.

KEY API
-------
ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([...])
    Builds a template out of (role, text) tuples. Text containing
    {placeholder} is filled in later with .invoke({"placeholder": value}).

    ("system", ...)    -> instructions for the model
    ("human", ...)     -> the user's question
