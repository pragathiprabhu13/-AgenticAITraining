"""common/schemas.py - Pydantic models for structured LLM outputs.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
A raw LLM reply is free text. When the application needs *fields* it can
rely on - a category, an answer, key points - we define a schema and ask the
model to fill it:

    result = llm.with_structured_output(FinanceAnswer).invoke(messages)

LangChain converts the schema to the provider's native mechanism
(function/tool calling on Gemini, JSON schema on Ollama) and validates the
reply into a Pydantic object. If the model returns something invalid,
Pydantic raises - which the application catches and falls back to plain text
(see D1P1.py and D1P3.py).

API USED
--------
pydantic.BaseModel   - declares the fields of the expected JSON object.
pydantic.Field(...)  - adds a description the model uses to fill the field.
typing.Literal[...]  - restricts a field to a fixed set of allowed values.
